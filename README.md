> [!WARNING]
> **Source pushes to this repository are paused for now, until further notice** — partly because a bit of the code has been finding its way into other paid projects, with no credit.
> Releases and localization are still kept up to date here — new builds land on the [Releases](https://github.com/faroukbmiled/RyukGram/releases/latest) page, and translation pull requests are still welcome.

### Optimization

# Translating RyukGram
Want to see RyukGram in your language? Two ways:

### Option A: In-app (fastest)
1. Open **Settings → Debug → Localization → Export strings** — pick a language (English for a fresh start, or an existing one to fix) and share its `.strings` file to yourself.
2. Translate the **right-hand side** of every `"key" = "value";` line. Never touch the left-hand side.
3. Go to **Debug → Localization → Update → + Add new language** — enter your language code (e.g. `fr`), pick the translated file, restart.
4. Your language now appears in the globe menu. Test it, tweak it, re-import as needed.
5. When ready, open a pull request with the file at `src/Localization/Resources/<code>.lproj/Localizable.strings`.

### Option B: PR directly
1. Copy `src/Localization/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings` into a new folder: `<code>.lproj/Localizable.strings`
2. Translate the right-hand side of every line.
3. Keep format specifiers (`%@`, `%lu`, `%d`, `%1$@`…) exactly as-is. Use positional specifiers if your language needs different word order.
4. Keep section banners and structure — makes the diff easy to review.
5. Open a PR at <https://github.com/faroukbmiled/RyukGram/pulls>. Title it e.g. `l10n: Add French translation`.

Partial translations are welcome — untranslated keys fall back to English at runtime.

If you find a string that still renders in English on a translated build, open an issue with a screenshot.

## Known Issues
- Preserved unsent messages cannot be removed using "Delete for you". Pull to refresh in the DMs tab clears the active account's preserved messages (with optional confirmation if "Warn before clearing on refresh" is enabled).
- "Delete for you" detection uses a ~2 second window after the local action. If a real other-party unsend happens to land in the same window, it may not be preserved. Rare in practice and limited to that specific overlap.
- With Liquid Glass buttons + Hide UI on capture both on, the DM eye leaves an empty glass bubble in captures — IG draws that backdrop, not the tweak, so it's outside our redaction.

# Building from source
### Prerequisites
- XCode + Command-Line Developer Tools
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/#install)
- [CMake](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmake#default) (`brew install cmake`)
- [Theos](https://theos.dev/docs/installation)
- [cyan](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw?tab=readme-ov-file#install-instructions) **\*only required for sideloading**
- [ipapatch](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/ipapatch/releases/latest) **\*only required for sideloading**

### Setup
1. Install iOS 16.2 frameworks for theos
   1. [Click to download iOS SDKs](https://github.com/xybp888/iOS-SDKs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
   2. Unzip, then copy the `iPhoneOS16.2.sdk` folder into `~/theos/sdks`
2. Clone repo: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/faroukbmiled/RyukGram`
3. **For sideloading**: Download a decrypted Instagram IPA from a trusted source, making sure to rename it to `com.burbn.instagram.ipa`.
   Then create a folder called `packages` inside of the project folder, and move the Instagram IPA file into it.

### Run build script
```sh
$ chmod +x build.sh
$ ./build.sh <sideload/sidestore/rootless/rootful>

### v32 ABI-aware runtime browser

The C symbol browser is no longer diagnostic-only. Validated return classes now map to ABI-aware runtime replacements:

- bool -> w0 hardstub/force
- int32/int64 -> x0/w0 typed numeric force
- double -> d0 typed force
- string/pointer -> x0 typed string/pointer force
- action/registration -> observe-only wrapper that calls original

DATA symbols are intentionally not function-hooked; use the DATA/param descriptor browser to identify the consumer/reader.
